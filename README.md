## Introduction

This project combines multiple components to create a sophisticated Arduino-based system. It uses an LDR to measure light levels, a servo motor to control the solar panel based on the direction of light, a buzzer to alert unauthorized access, and a gate control mechanism. The provided Arduino code showcases how these components can be integrated to create a functional system.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Solar Panel
- Servo Motor
- Led
- Buzzer
- Gate Mechanism (e.g., a motor or an actuator)
- Resistors and connecting wires
- Breadboard (if necessary)

## Circuit Setup

1. Set up the LDR circuit:
   - Connect the LDR to an analog pin on the Arduino.
   - Use a resistor to create a voltage divider circuit with the LDR.
   
2. Set up the solar panel and servo motor circuit:
   - Connect the servo motor's control pin to a PWM pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the solar panel to the Arduino for power.
   
3. Set up the buzzer circuit:
   - Connect the buzzer to a digital pin on the Arduino.
   
4. Set up the gate control mechanism:
   - Connect the gate control component (motor or actuator) to a digital pin on the Arduino.

**Note:** The exact connections might vary depending on your specific components and project requirements.

## Code Explanation

### LDR Code (`ldr_code.ino`)

The LDR code reads the analog value from the LDR and controls two LEDs. If the LDR reading is below a threshold (300 in this case), the LEDs turn on, simulating a low light environment. If the reading is above the threshold, the LEDs turn off.

### Solar Panel Code (`solar_code.ino`)

The solar panel code reads the values from two LDR sensors (`LDR1` and `LDR2`). Based on the difference between their readings, a servo motor attached to pin 11 is controlled. The servo motor's position changes according to the difference in light intensity between the two LDRs.

### Buzzer

The buzzer blows if someone is trying to jump across your wall. It is been sensed using a ultrasonic sensor.

### Gate Control

The gate control mechanism is integrated into the circuit. However, the specific wiring and code for these components are not provided in this repository. You can adapt the existing code to control the gate mechanism based on certain conditions.


## Usage

1. Set up the circuit according to the instructions provided in the "Circuit Setup" section.
2. Upload the respective Arduino code files to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to observe any relevant program output.
